1. User Guessing Game
The app selects a random number within a user-defined range.
The user guesses the number, with feedback provided on each guess:
Too Low: The guess is smaller than the target number.
Too High: The guess is larger than the target number.
Correct: The user guesses the number correctly, and the number of attempts is displayed.
2. Machine Guessing Game
The user thinks of a number within a specified range.
The app tries to guess the user's number using a binary search algorithm:
The app narrows the range based on feedback from the user (Too Low, Too High, or Correct).
The app displays each guess and tracks the number of attempts.
